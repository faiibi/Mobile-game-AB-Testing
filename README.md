## Introduction

A/B testing is a crucial method for assessing the impact of changes in digital products. This project analyzes the performance of a mobile game using A/B testing techniques to evaluate key metrics and improve user engagement and monetization.

## Project Overview

This Python-based project focuses on performing A/B testing on data collected from a mobile game. It aims to:

	1.	Analyze user engagement and retention metrics.
	2.	Compare the performance of two test groups.
	3.	Draw actionable insights from the results to optimize game design or monetization strategies.

 ## Features
 
	•	Data Loading and Preprocessing: Handles raw A/B test data.
	•	Descriptive Statistics: Summarizes key metrics for control and test groups.
	•	Statistical Testing: Implements hypothesis testing using metrics like t-tests and chi-square tests.
	•	Visualization: Graphs and plots for result interpretation.

## Results

Key outputs of the analysis include:

	•	Engagement and retention metrics for control and test groups.
	•	Statistical significance of differences between groups.
	•	Visualization of group performance to support decision-making.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following Python libraries:

	•	pandas
	•	numpy
	•	matplotlib
	•	seaborn
	•	scipy
